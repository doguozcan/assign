# Assign

## About

Assign is an app that I have built in order to practice my intermediate Redux skills. With assign, a manager can assign tasks to his/her employees.

## Features

- **Asign tasks to employees**: You can give tasks to specific employees. After assignment, you can edit the task and the user.
- **Emojis**: You can give reactions to tasks with specific emojis.
- **RTK and React Redux Features**: RTK's hooks such as configureStore, createSlice or react-redux's methods such as useSelector and useDispatch used in the app so you can practice your Redux skills with this app.
